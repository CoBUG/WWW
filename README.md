# CoBUG.org website

Here are the bits for generating a Hugo version of the CoBUG site.

I chose Hugo because:
- It's built in Go and runs most everywhere.
- The templating stuff is pretty easy to understand.
- It can generate completely static sites.

## TODO

- [ ] Mobile
- [ ] Tweak the layout a bit. Thing's are sorta misplaced.
- [ ] More content. I'd like to be able to render the slide shows vi reveal or similar.
